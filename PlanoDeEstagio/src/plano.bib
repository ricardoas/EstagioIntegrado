	abstract = {{Grid computing is applying the resources of many computers in a network to a single problem at the same time <P> Grid computing appears to be a promising trend for three reasons: <BR> (1) Its ability to make more cost-effective use of a given amount of computer resources, <BR> (2) As a way to solve problems that can't be approached without an enormous amount of computing power <BR> (3) Because it suggests that the resources of many computers can be cooperatively and perhaps synergistically harnessed and managed as a collaboration toward a common objective. <P> A number of corporations, professional groups, university consortiums, and other groups have developed or are developing frameworks and software for managing grid computing projects. The European Community (EU) is sponsoring a project for a grid for high-energy physics, earth observation, and biology applications. In the United States, the National Technology Grid is prototyping a computational grid for infrastructure and an access grid for people. Sun Microsystems offers Grid Engine software. Described as a distributed resource management tool, Grid Engine allows engineers at companies like Sony and Synopsys to pool the computer cycles on up to 80 workstations at a time. <BR> <BR> <ul> <li> "the Grid" is a very hot topic generating broad interest from research and industry (e.g. IBM, Platform, Avaki, Entropia, Sun, HP) <li> Grid architecture enables very popular e-Science projects like the Genome project which demand global interaction and networking <li> In recent surveys over 500f Chief Information Officers are expected to use Grid technology this year </ul>  Grid Computing: <li> Features contributions from the major players in the field <li> Covers all aspects of grid technology from motivation to applications <li> Provides an extensive state-of-the-art guide in grid computing <P> This is essential reading for researchers in Computing and Engineering, physicists, statisticians, engineers and mathematicians and IT policy makers. <P> } {"""A few years ago ‘The Grid’ emerged as one of the most important new developments in building the infrastructure for computational science in the 21st century. The tremendous enthusiasm for grid computing has led to an extremely rapid growth of our knowledge about how to make grids a reality. This is a timely book with contributions by the world’s leading experts on building grids – it synthesizes all the exciting developments of the recent years. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in a comprehensive and up to date treatment of one of the most important topics in computing.""Horst D. Simon, Director, NERSC Center and Computational Research. The Grid is the computing and data management infrastructure that will provide the electronic underpinning for a global society. As our life styles change with the development of technology, the demand for global interaction and networking in business, government, research, science and entertainment increases. The Grid integrates networking, communication, computation and information to provide a virtual platform for computation and data management, just as the Internet provides a virtual platform for access to information. Using the Grid, users can access remote computers and gain the ability to use networked resources (computers, data archives, scientific instruments, etc.) together to solve a single problem. Large-scale grids are intrinsically distributed, heterogeneous and dynamic. They promise effectively infinite cycles and storage, as well as access to instruments, visualization devices, and much more, without regard to geographic location. To make good this promise, complex systems of software and services must be developed. In this book the authors consider the Grid in depth, describing its immense potential and complexity from the perspective of the community of individuals working hard to transform the Grid computing vision into reality.}},

While the Net allows users everywhere to share information, the Grid will allow users to share raw computing power. The goal is to put full supercomputing capabilities into the hands of anyone who needs it while providing for more efficient use of the supercomputers of tomorrow. The potential benefits to science, government, and business may well be beyond imagination.<p> Foster and Kesselman have gathered together essays, proposals, and ruminations of more than 30 distinguished stars of the high-speed computing and networking world in order to do four things: make the case for developing computational grids, provide ideas on how such grids may be designed, demonstrate how the grids might be used, and point out the research still needed to make it happen. While the book was written to serve as a possible textbook in advanced networking, it makes fascinating reading for anyone interested in the future of network computing.<p> The text covers Grid applications, the programming tools required, the services that will be provided, and an examination of Grid infrastructure.

Today, the project continues to explore the social and technical problems of cooperative computing on scales ranging from the desktop to the world-wide computational Grid.

@article{ourgrid,
	abstract = {Abstract\&nbsp;\&nbsp;eScience is rapidly changing the way we do research. As a result, many research labs now need non-trivial computational power. Grid and voluntary computing are well-established solutions for this need. However, not all labs can effectively benefit from these technologies. In particular, small and medium research labs (which are the majority of the labs in the world) have a hard time using these technologies as they demand high visibility projects and/or high-qualified computer personnel. This paper describes OurGrid, a system designed to fill this gap. OurGrid is an open, free-to-join, cooperative Grid in which labs donate their idle computational resources in exchange for accessing other labs’ idle resources when needed. It relies on an incentive mechanism that makes it in the best interest of participants to collaborate with the system, employs a novel application scheduling technique that demands very little information, and uses virtual machines to isolate applications and thus provide security. The vision is that OurGrid enables labs to combine their resources in a massive worldwide computing platform. OurGrid is in production since December 2004. Any lab can join it by downloading its software from http://www.ourgrid.org.},
